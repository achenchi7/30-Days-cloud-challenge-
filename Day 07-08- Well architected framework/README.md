# AWS well-architected framework

### Definition
To put it simply, the AWS well-architected framework is a collection of best practices and guidelines for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud.

It is built upon 6 pillars. Namely:
- Operational excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance
- Efficiency
- Cost-optimization
- Sustainability\

**Acronym** to remember it by: **S-C-O-R-E-S**

## 1. Operational Excellence
This pillar focuses on the ability to support development and run workloads effectively.\
This will mean diving into operations metrics and continuously evolvng processes and procedures over time.

## 2. Security
This pillar focuses on protection - protection of data, systems and any assets you may have on the cloud or interacting with the cloud environment.\
This pillar dives into 6 best practices:
- security
- IAM
- Detection
- infrastructure protection
- data protection
- incident response

## 3. Reliability
This pillar aims to ensure workloads perform **correctly** and **consistently**\
Preparing for the worst case scenario.\
The four best practices:
- foundations
- workload architecture
- change management
- failure management

## 4. Performance efficiency
Focuses on utilizing computing resources efficiently to balance meeting system requirements.\
This means compute optimization, vigilant monitoring, and consistency.\
The 4 best practices are:
- selection
- review
- monitoring
- tradeoffs

## 5. Cost optimization
This pillar zeroes in on how to continuously run your workload while meeting the lowest price point.\
The 6 best practices are:
- practice cloud financial management
- expenditure and usage awareness
- cost-effective resources
- manage demand and supply resources
- optimize over time

## 6. Sustainability
This pillar shines the spotlight on the environmental impact of your workload. This includes energy consumption and efficiency as well as resource usage.\
The 6 best practices are:
- region selection
- user behaviour patterns
- software and architecture patterns
- data patterns
- hardware patterns
- development and deployment patterns
