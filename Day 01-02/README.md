## Setting up your AWS account
Days 01 and 02 involved setting up my AWS account from where I would have access to a vast amount of services offered by AWS and setting up my billing preferences and budget alerts to avoid unexpected charges. AWS offers a generous 12-month free tier. The free tier offers the [following](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23compute)

The steps involved in setting up your AWS account are:
1. On your preferred web browser, search [AWS Sign up](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email)
2. Input your **root user email address** and your preferred **account name**
3. A verification code will be sent to the email address to verify your email.
4. Setting up your account involves 5 steps:
    - **Step 1** involves setting up your root password
    - **Step 2** involves keying in address and contact information
    - **Step 3** involves providing your credit card information. Do not be alarmed, you will not be charged unless you exceed your free tier provisions and/or your free tier period comes to an end.
    - **Step 4** involves confirmation of your identity by AWS either through text message or a call. Right of the bat, you can note the security redundancy that AWS offers.
    - **Step 5** finally. Select your preferred support plan. For learning and economic purposes ðŸ˜‚, I chose the Basic suppert-free.
