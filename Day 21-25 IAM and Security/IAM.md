# What is IAM?
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. It is a web service that helps you to securely control access to AWS resources. Several principles are used in the control of access to resources. They include:

**1. Principle of least privilege**
This principle gives a user or system only those privileges that are essential to perform its intended function. No more. This security principle entails the following:
- **Grant access as needed**- This means that you grant access to data and other resources to only the people who really need that access.

- **Enforce separation of duties**- Set expectations on how authority will be delegated.

-  **Avoid long-term credentials**- Make use of temporary credentials that eventually expire to limit exposure to your resources.
