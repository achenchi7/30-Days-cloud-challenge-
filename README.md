# 30 Day Cloud challenge
As part of my transition to cloud computing, I am currently taking part in the 30-day cloud challenge organized by the [Cozy Cloud Crew](https://cozycloudcrew.com/#discord)

This repository is my digital footprint through this journey. In it I recount what I have learned, the challenges faced, and the solutions sought. Enjoy ðŸ‘Œ.

NB: I should note that one challenge was spread out on a span of 2-3 days to enhance retention, and understanding, and reduce fatigue.
