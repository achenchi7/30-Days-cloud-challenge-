## Tweaks I am learning along the way on navigating Github
1. ### Create a folder
In your preferred repo, click on **Add file** button
Click *Create new file*
Input the name you'd want to call your folder together with a backslash (/). For example **AWS Storage/** then input a file name

NOTE: Github does not allow for empty folders. At the bare minimum a markdown file should be there in your new folder

2. ### Editing the name of a folder
To edit the name of an already created folder, navigate to the file within the folder.
In edit, mode, have your cursor before the first letter of your file then press backspace
Edit your folder name in peace then commit the changes.
