# What is a database?
A **database** is a logically organized collection of information designed in such a way that the information can be accessed for later use by a computer program.

## Types of databases
- Relational databases - Ideal for structured data
- Non-relational databases - Ideal for unstructured and/or semi-structured data

| Relational databases | Non-relational databases|
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| - Data records are organized in a set of tables and rows |- Stores data in unstructured ways using key-value pairs, documents or graphs |
| - Each row holds info about a record and columns contain attributes of the data|- A row does not contain data for each column. Non-relational databases scale out horizontally |
| - Each row has an identifier column to uniquely distinguish the record from other records. The value in the identifier column is called a **primary key**|- Was designed to overcome the limitations of relational databases for handling demands of variable structured data |

## Use cases
