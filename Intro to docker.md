# Docker
It's been a year or so since I heard of docker and it's been a week since I started interacting, practicing, and reading about it. Boy, is it vast? Like any novice out here, I have started with the fundamentals and I am not only fascinated but also amazed by this technology. Let's get to it.

## So, What is Docker?
In layman's terms, docker is a platform that 'houses' applications in a container. Think of it as a bus whose seats are occupied by passengers. The bus is **Docker application**, the seats are **Containers** and the passengers are **your application**. 

The importance of this system is to retain the 'originality' of your application that you spent hours and several cups of coffee on. If my app, for example, a fitness app runs in my machine in Kenya, the very app should and will run in someone else's machine in Minnesota using docker containers.
